**Subject:** Student Research Inquiry: ZKS Protocol (New Trustless Anonymity Network)

Dear Software Freedom Conservancy Team,

My name is **Wasif Faisal**, and I am an undergraduate student researcher at **BRAC University**.

I am writing to share a new open-source privacy protocol I have developed called **Zero Knowledge Swarm (ZKS)**, and to seek guidance on how to best steward this project for the public good.

### The Project
ZKS is a trustless, metadata-free overlay network designed to address the "Node Enumeration" and "Traffic Correlation" vulnerabilities inherent in Tor. It is fully open-source and licensed under **AGPLv3**.

**Repository:** [https://github.com/cswasif/zks](https://github.com/cswasif/zks)

### Technical Innovations
My research introduces three core novelties to the field of anonymity networks:

1.  **Faisal-Swarm Topology (Triple-Blind Architecture)**:
    Unlike Tor's direct circuit connections, ZKS nodes communicate exclusively through "Blind Relays". This creates a "Split Knowledge" graph where the Entry Node never knows the Exit Node's IP, and vice versa. This mathematically prevents a single entity from mapping the circuit path.

2.  **Wasif-Vernam Cipher (Double-Key Encryption)**:
    I have implemented a distributed variant of the One-Time Pad. Traffic is encrypted using two keys:
    *   $K_{Local}$: Generated by the user's device (CSPRNG).
    *   $K_{Remote}$: Generated by the network swarm.
    *   **Result**: Information-Theoretic Security. Even if the network infrastructure is compromised, the data remains mathematically undecryptable without the user's local key.

3.  **Swarm Entropy Tax (Trustless Key Generation)**:
    To eliminate trust in centralized RNGs (like Cloudflare LavaRand), ZKS derives entropy from the swarm itself. Every connected peer contributes random noise, making the encryption keys a product of the entire network's state.

### My Request
As a student researcher passionate about software freedom and privacy, I am looking for resources or mentorship. Does the Conservancy offer any guidance for student-led FOSS projects that are tackling high-stakes privacy challenges?

I believe ZKS has the potential to protect journalists and activists in oppressive regimes, and I want to ensure its governance and legal structure are built correctly from day one.

Thank you for your time and your advocacy for free software.

Sincerely,

**Wasif Faisal**
